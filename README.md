# Calculator
Individually created a terminal-based calculator app which takes user inputed mathematical expression which includes three integer values and two operators and calculates and clearly outputs the answer within the terminal.

This was achieved by performing operations on dynamically-typed variables and accepting and analyzing user inputs. The calculator outputs the correct answer using control flow logic using data comparison following mathematical rules (BEDMAS).
